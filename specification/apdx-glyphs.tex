% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following pages present all current glyphs for SBOL Visual, organized by glyph families.
Each entry lists:
\begin{itemize}
\item Glyph family name
\item Associated ontology terms
\item Recommended and alternate glyphs
\item At least one example of when this glyph would be used
\item Any additional notes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sequence Feature Glyphs}\label{apdx:sym:feature}

These glyphs represent features of nucleic acid sequences, and include a bounding box (grey dashed box) and a recommended alignment to the nucleic acid backbone (grey dashed horizontal line).

\input{glyphscript/glyphs.tex}


\subsection{Molecular Species Glyphs}\label{apdx:sym:species}

These glyphs represent molecular species in a diagram, and include a bounding box (grey dashed box) but are not connected to any nucleic acid backbone.

\input{glyphscript/speciesglyphs.tex}


\subsection{Interaction Glyphs}\label{apdx:sym:interaction}

These glyphs are different forms of ``arrow'' representing interactions between sequence features and/or molecular species. As arrows, they are extensible and do not have a separately identified bounding box.

\subsection{Interaction Node Glyphs}\label{apdx:sym:interactionnodes}

These glyphs are placed at the junctions of edges to represent biochemical processes, and include a bounding box (grey dashed box) but are not connected to any nucleic acid backbone. Grey dashed lines provide examples of how edges may connect to the glyph.
