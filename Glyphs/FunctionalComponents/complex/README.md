# Complex

## Associated SBO term(s)
SBO:0000253 Non-covalent complex

## Recommended Glyph and Alternates
The RECOMMENDED glyph for a complex is a composite of the glyphs for the molecules comprising the complex.  For example, a protein bound to a simple chemical, a guide RNA, or another protein (in order:protein-small molecule, protein-guide RNA, protein-protein):

This may also be applied to show complex formation (binding) of a molecule to a nucleic acid construct by compositing the molecule glyph with the appropriate portion of the nucleic acid construct. For example, a protein binding to the promoter of a transcriptional unit:

An alternative is the SBGN "cornered rectangle" glyph for a complex:

## Prototypical Example

Arabinose bound to AraC
