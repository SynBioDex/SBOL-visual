This section contains prototypical examples, including use of all
current glyphs to attempt to ensure that their use is clear.

\caption{The same functional unit as in \ref{f:apdx:exa1}, with additional assembly-focused information: there is a 5' overhang before the promoter, a 3' overhand after the terminator, and an assembly scar between the promoter and the ribosome entry site left over from a prior step of assembly.}

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/apdx-examples/apdx-exa6.pdf}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/apdx-examples/apdx-exa8.pdf}
\caption{Promoter regulating the production of an engineered composite sequence that includes RNA and protein stability elements at its 3' end, as well as an internal site for protease cleavage, as well as the expansion of the composite to show it contains a ribosome entry site. coding sequence, and other omitted details.  Single residue locations of interest are indicated for the DNA (before the promoter), RNA (after the ribosome entry site), and protein (in the CDS).}

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/apdx-examples/apdx-exa11.pdf}
\caption{Promoter regulating the expression of GFP, which is also regulated by an aptamer between it and the poly-A tail of the transcript. The promoter can be cut out by a pair of recombinase target sites, which are acted on by the Flp protein.  The whole construct is stored in a circular plasmid with an origin of replication and also an origin of transfer.}
