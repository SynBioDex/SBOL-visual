## Abstract

Molecular Species glyphs are currently defined in terms of BioPAX terms, which is limiting and does not match with SBO used for Interactions and Interaction Nodes. This SEP proposes changing to SBO, keeping BioPAX as an alternative for backward compatibility until SBOL 3.0.

## 1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>

BioPAX gives definitions for very few classes of molecular species: in fact, the SBOL Visual set of glyphs already covers all of the few molecular species terms in BioPAX.  This is much smaller than the set of terms that are likely to be of interest for glyphs, however.

Moreover, SBOL Visual is intended to be a compatible with SBGN, which uses SBO terms. SBOL Visual Interactions and Interaction Nodes all use SBO terms. The SBGN glyphs imported, however, are not currently labelled with the SBO terms but with BioPAX terms. In one case, this is even incompatible: BioPAX#Protein is _not_ equivalent to SBO#Macromolecule.

As such, this SEP proposed to make all Molecular Species glyphs in SBOL Visual use SBO terms matching SBGN as their recommended definitions instead, retaining BioPAX as an alternate definition wheere appropriate.

## 2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>

### Specification Changes

The specification will be modified in the glyphs section as follows:

* Replace:

  > Molecular Species Glyphs ... are associated with BioPAX terms.
  
  with:
  
  > Molecular Species Glyphs ... are associated with Systems Biology Ontology terms.  
  
* Replace: 
  
  > Definitions are RECOMMENDED to be from the Sequence Ontology for nucleic acid components, from BioPAX for other components, and from the Systems Biology Ontology for interactions.  
  
  with:
  
  > Definitions are RECOMMENDED to be from the Sequence Ontology for sequence feature glyphs, from the Systems Biology Ontology for molecular species glyphs, and from the Systems Biology Ontology for interaction glyphs.  
  
(the second change incidentally corrects the names of the glyph classes as well).

## 3. Examples <a name='example'></a>

No examples are needed.

## 4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>

BioPAX terms are used throughout SBOL 2 data models, so will be retained as an acceptable secondary definition for glyphs.

## 5. Discussion <a name='discussion'></a>
