## Recommended Glyph and Alternates

Biopolymer Location is a "stem-top" glyph for describing small sites. In this system:

- the top glyph indicates the type of site (e.g., Biopolymer Location)
- the stem glyph indicates whether the site affects DNA, RNA, or protein (respectively: straight, wavy, or looped)

The RECOMMENDED top for Biopolymer Location is a circle, reminiscent of a pin stuck into a location (left to right: DNA, RNA, Protein):

An alternative is to have "nothing" for the top, just an extended version of the stem itself (left to right: DNA, RNA, Protein):

## Prototypical Example

CRISPR-targeted insertion site, protease site, mutation site

## Notes
Biopolymer Location is a general glyph for all zero- and one-length sequence features, including insertion and deletion sites and X-ase cut sites.

Note also that Biopolymer Location does not cover stability elements, since their length is typically multiple bases / amino acids.
