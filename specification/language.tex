\section{SBOL Visual Diagram Language}
\label{sec:language}
% % -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

An SBOL Visual diagram represents information about the structure of a biological design.
SBOL Visual is particularly concerned with enabling clear communication about the structure of nucleic acid designs, though there is no requirement that a diagram include such.

If desired, an SBOL Visual diagram may also be associated with a machine-interpretable model (e.g., in SBOL, GenBank, or SBML format).
In this document we describe the association with the SBOL 3 data mode~\citep{SBOL3_0}l, which provides a formal semantic grounding for all elements of an SBOL Visual diagram, but equivalent associations may be made between diagram elements and other models.
%
In terms of the SBOL 3 data model, the description of a nucleic acid design is formally defined as a representation of a \sbol{Component}, the \sbol{Feature} objects describing its design, the \sbol{Interaction} and \sbol{Participation} objects describing their functional relationships, and the \sbol{Constraint} objects describing relationships of relative location, orientation, topology, and identity.

a diagram for a nucleic acid construct is based around a backbone line, its structure specified by the sequence of attached sequence feature glyphs.  
Strand can optionally be indicated by placing a glyph above or below the backbone.  
Other molecular species are indicated by glyphs not in contact with any backbone.
Interactions are directed edges connecting sequence feature or molecular species glyphs.
Any of these objects may have an associated label showing its name, and the diagram may further include any form of other annotations, including other types of text.}

Specifically, an SBOL Visual diagram consists of the classes of objects illustrated in \ref{f:syntax}.
\ref{f:example} shows an example of such a diagram, in a typical usage.
Full details of this specification are provided in the remainder of this section.


\subsection{Nucleic Acid Backbone}
\label{s:lang:backbone}

A diagram for a nucleic acid construct is based around a single or double line, representing the nucleic acid backbone. 
Information about features of the construct can then be represented by attaching sequence feature glyphs to the backbone, as defined below in \ref{s:lang:nacomponent}.

In terms of the SBOL 3 data model, the backbone represents any clustering of \sbol{Feature} objects that describe the structure of a single nucleic acid construct. 
In particular, a two \sbol{Feature} objects MAY be placed together on a nucleic acid backbone if:
\begin{itemize}
\item both \sbol{Feature} objects are children of the same \sbol{Component} with a nucleic acid \sbol{type} (e.g., DNA, RNA), or
\item both \sbol{Feature} objects have a \sbol{Location} on the same nucleic acid \sbol{Sequence}, or
\item the two \sbol{Feature} objects are linked together by a \sbol{Constraint} relation indicating their relative sequence location or orientation.
\end{itemize}
If two \sbol{Feature} objects do not have any such relation or chain of relations through other \sbol{Feature} objects, then they MUST NOT be placed on the same backbone.

The rules for use of nucleic acid backbones in diagrams are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Lines in some cases indicate strand count. 
	A double-stranded region of the nucleic acid construct MAY use either a single or double line for the backbone.  
	A single-stranded region of the nucleic acid construct MUST use a single line to indicate the backbone.
	When single and double lines are mixed within a single diagram, the single lines always indicate single-stranded regions.
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:1a}.
	
	\begin{figure}[h!]

	\subfigure[Single- or double-strand backbone]{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/examples/1a-singlestrand.pdf}}

	\caption{Examples of indicating strand count in nucleic acid backbones.}
	\label{exa:1a}
	\end{figure}
		
\item A nucleic acid backbone SHOULD be horizontal in orientation, 
	but MAY use non-horizontal structure to indicate important physical attributes 
	(e.g., a closed loop to indicate a cyclic plasmid or more complex shapes for DNA nanotech structures).   
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:1b}.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=6in]{figures/examples/1b.pdf}
	\caption{Recommended, acceptable, and problematic examples of nucleic backbone orientation.}
	\label{exa:1b}
	\end{figure}
	
\item As a special case of non-horizontal backbone structure, certain stylized backbone shapes are used as sequence feature glyphs to indicate the genomic context of a sequence. 
	These glyphs SHOULD be used as a matched pair, indicating the bounds of the context region.
	It is further RECOMMENDED that each glyph be concatenated with an Omitted Detail glyph to explicitly indicate that some surrounding context is not being shown. 
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:1c}.

	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\subfigure[Functional unit on a circular plasmid]{\includegraphics[scale=1]{figures/examples/1c-circular-plasmid.pdf}}

	\caption{Examples of RECOMMENDED indication of genomic context.}
	\label{exa:1c}
	\end{figure}

\item A nucleic acid backbone SHOULD have at least one associated feature glyph (else no structural information is being provided).
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Sequence Features}
\label{s:lang:nacomponent}

A sequence feature glyph in contact with a nucleic acid backbone indicates a feature of the nucleic acid sequence.
% 
In terms of the SBOL 3 data model, this is a \sbol{Feature} with a nucleic acid \sbol{type} that is associated with that nucleic acid backbone by the clustering rules given in~\ref{s:lang:backbone}.
The \sbol{Feature} may be contained either directly, as one of the children of the \sbol{Component} represented by the diagram, or recursively through a sequence of \sbol{SubComponent} relationships.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every feature glyph MUST have its bounding box in contact with the backbone for the nucleic acid construct it describes. 
The placement of the glyph SHOULD follow the recommendation for backbone alignment in the glyph specification.
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:2a}.
   	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\subfigure[MUST]{\includegraphics[width=3in]{figures/examples/2a-contact.pdf}}
	\subfigure[MUST NOT]{\includegraphics[width=3in]{figures/examples/2a-noncontact.pdf}}
	\caption{Examples of correct and incorrect association of glyphs with a nucleic acid backbone.}
	\label{exa:2a}
	\end{figure}

\item The horizontal orientation of a glyph can be used to indicate the strand alignment of a feature, as shown in \ref{f:orientation}. 
	Any glyphs for a feature associated with the inline strand SHOULD be placed in the prototypical orientation given by the specification,
	while any glyph that is associated with the reverse complement strand SHOULD be inverted vertically and horizontally (i.e., rotated 180 degrees). 
	Reverse complement MAY also be indicated by horizontal-only inversion.
	Finally, a glyph inverted only vertically still indicates inline strand, but it is RECOMMENDED NOT to use this orientation.
	Orientation SHOULD be used consistently throughout a diagram, rather than mixing conventions.
	Examples are provided in \ref{exa:2b}.
	
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{figures/orientation.pdf}
	\caption{Use of glyph orientation to indicate inline vs. reverse complement direction.}
	\label{f:orientation}
	\end{figure} 
	
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=5in]{figures/examples/2b.pdf}
	\caption{Example construct incorporating both inline (+) and reverse complement (-) features.}
	\label{exa:2b}
	\end{figure} 

\item Nucleic acid features in a sequential relationship SHOULD be drawn from 5' left to 3' right on the inline strand and from 5' right to 3' left on the reverse complement strand.
	In terms of the SBOL 3 data model, this indicates a \sbol{Constraint} on the relative ordering of two features.

\item Nucleic acid features that do not overlap in their locations SHOULD NOT have glyphs whose bounding boxes overlap.
	An example is provided in~\ref{exa:2d}.
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=3in]{figures/examples/2d.pdf}
	\caption{Example of incorrect glyph overlap: promoter (arrow) does not overlap in sequence with the ribosome entry site and CDS, so SHOULD NOT overlap visually with them.}
	\label{exa:2d}
	\end{figure}

\item Nucleic acid features that overlap in their locations SHOULD have glyphs whose bounding boxes overlap.  Overlap size MAY be used to indicate relative position.
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:2e}.

	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\subfigure[Restriction site in a CDS]{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/examples/2e-cutsite.pdf}}
	\subfigure[3'-side operator in a promoter]{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/examples/2e-promoter.pdf}}
	\subfigure[5'-side operator in a promoter]{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/examples/2e-promoter2.pdf}}
	\caption{Examples where glyphs SHOULD overlap, but might not if it is more clear, e.g., with an operator site located within the 5' portion of a promoter.}
	\label{exa:2e}
	\end{figure}

\item A nucleic acid feature SHOULD be represented using a glyph defined in \ref{apdx:sym:feature}.  In this case, the feature MUST be contained within at least one of the glyph's associated terms.
In terms of the SBOL 2 data model, this means the glyph is equal to or a parent of at least one of the \sbol{roles} for the \sbol{Feature} or its associated \sbol{Component} if it is a \sbol{SubComponent}.
	Moreover, the glyph used SHOULD be the RECOMMENDED variant of the most specific applicable glyph.  Note that novel glyphs not defined in \ref{apdx:sym:feature} MAY be used, but SHOULD be proposed for adoption as described in \ref{sec:extension}.
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:2f}.
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\subfigure[SHOULD]{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/examples/2f-recommended.pdf}}
	\subfigure[MAY]{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/examples/2f-custom.pdf}}
	\subfigure[SHOULD NOT]{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/examples/2f-generic.pdf}}
	\subfigure[MUST NOT]{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/examples/2f-conflict.pdf}}
	\caption{Examples of recommended, allowed, and forbidden representation of a \sbol{Component} comprising a sequence of promoter, ribosome entry site, CDS, and terminator: (a) is RECOMMENDED because it uses the preferred variant of the most specific defined glyphs, (b) is allowed because it uses some novel custom non-conflicting symbol, not matching any glyph defined in this document, to encode more specific information about the particular CDS, (c) is recommended against because it uses less specific glyphs, and (d) is forbidden because it use a promoter symbol to represent the terminator.}
	\label{exa:2f}
	\end{figure}
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Molecular Species}

A glyph that is not in contact with any backbone represents any class of molecule whose detailed structure is not being shown using sequence feature glyphs.
In other words, either not a nucleic acid (e.g., proteins, small molecules) or else an ``uninteresting'' nucleic acid (e.g., showing a transcribed mRNA, but not the features of its sequence).
In terms of the SBOL 3 data model, these are also \sbol{Feature} objects contained within the overall \sbol{Component} for the diagram.

\begin{enumerate}
\item A molecular species SHOULD be represented using a glyph defined in \ref{apdx:sym:species}.  In this case, the species MUST be contained within at least one of the glyph's associated SBO terms.
In terms of the SBOL 3 data model, this means the SBO term for the glyph is equal to or a parent of at least one of the \sbol{types} for the associated \sbol{Feature} or its type-defining referent (i.e., the \sbol{Component} linked by \sbol{instanceOf} for a \sbol{SubComponent} or the type associated with the linked \sbol{Feature} for a \sbol{ComponentReference}).
	Moreover, the glyph used SHOULD be the RECOMMENDED variant of the most specific applicable glyph.  Note that novel glyphs not defined in \ref{apdx:sym:species} MAY be used, but SHOULD be proposed for adoption as described in \ref{sec:extension}.
	
\item The bounding box of a molecular species glyph MUST NOT contact any nucleic acid construct unless there is an interaction between the molecular species and the nucleic acid construct.  

\item If a molecular species glyph overlaps a nucleic acid construct, then the location of the overlap SHOULD correspond with the location of an interaction on the nucleic acid construct.
	The molecular species glyph SHOULD be visually distinct from a sequence feature glyph.
	This location is RECOMMENDED to be represented with a sequence feature glyph appropriate to the interaction (e.g., a binding site or restriction site). 
	Examples are provided in \ref{exa:3}.

	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\subfigure[RECOMMENDED]{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/examples/3-binding.pdf}}
	\subfigure[MAY]{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/examples/3-bindpromoter.pdf}}
	\subfigure[SHOULD NOT]{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/examples/3-wronglocation.pdf}}
	\caption{Examples of recommended, allowed, and not recommended representation of an interaction between a molecular species and a nucleic acid construct, in this case regulation of a promoter by a transcription factor protein that binds on the 5' side of the promoter: 
	(a) shows the RECOMMENDED representation, (b) shows a more generic alternative, and (c) is recommended against because the location does not corresponding with the binding.}
	\label{exa:3}
	\end{figure}

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Interactions}

A directed edge ``arrow'' attached to one or more glyphs indicates a functional interaction involving those elements.
The roles of the elements is indicated by their position at the head or tail of the edge.
In terms of the SBOL 2 data model, this is an \sbol{Interaction}, with either one or two \sbol{Participation} relationships, their \sbol{role} set by position at the head or tail of the edge.
	An example is provided in~\ref{exa:4}.

	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=3in]{figures/examples/4-regulation.pdf}
	\caption{Example of an interaction indicating a promoter stimulated by the CDS that it regulates.}
	\label{exa:4}
	\end{figure}
		
\begin{enumerate}
\item Two interaction edges SHOULD NOT cross one another.  When edges cross, they MUST indicate the distinction between arrows with a crossover pattern, in which one edge ``diverts'' at the intersection (see \ref{f:crossover}).
Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:4c}.

	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=4in]{figures/crossovers.pdf}
	\caption{Examples of \sbol{Interaction} crossover patterns.}
	\label{f:crossover}

	\subfigure[SHOULD]{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/examples/4c-noncrossing.pdf}}
	\subfigure[MAY]{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/examples/4c-crossover.pdf}}
	\subfigure[MUST NOT]{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/examples/4c-conflict.pdf}}
	\caption{Examples of recommended, allowed, and forbidden relationships between two interactions in a mutual repression system: (a) non-crossing is recommended, (b) using a crossover pattern is allowed, but (c) crossing without a crossover pattern is forbidden, since the relationship between the two edges is ambiguous.}
	\label{exa:4c}
	\end{figure}

\item An interaction SHOULD be represented using a glyph defined in \ref{apdx:sym:interaction}.  In this case, the interaction type MUST be contained within at least one of the glyph's associated terms.
In terms of the SBOL 2 data model, this means the glyph is equal to or a parent of at least one of the \sbol{types} for the \sbol{Interaction}, and that each associated \sbol{Participation} object has a \sbol{role} compatible with its position on the head or tail of the edge.
	Moreover, the glyph used SHOULD be the RECOMMENDED variant of the most specific applicable glyph.  Note that novel glyphs not defined in \ref{apdx:sym:interaction} MAY be used, but SHOULD be proposed for adoption as described in \ref{sec:extension}.

\item An edge may have multiple heads or multiple tails. 
In this case, a split or join in an edge represents either multiple participants with the same role (e.g., a transcription factor repressing two instances of a promoter) or a biochemical process (e.g., association of an inducible protein and a small molecule to form an active complex).  
An edge with multiple heads MUST use the same glyph for each head.
An edge that splits or joins with no glyph at the junction represents multiple participants with the same role.
Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:4d}.

	\begin{figure}[h!]

	\subfigure[MAY]{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/examples/4d-multisource.pdf}}

	\caption{Examples of use of multi-head and multi-tail arrows: 
	(a) Repression from multiple independent sources and (b) repressor with multiple targets.
	(c) Multi-head interactions, however, MUST NOT use different glyphs for different heads.}
	\label{exa:4d}
	\end{figure}

	\begin{figure}[h!]

	\subfigure[MAY]{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/examples/4d-association.pdf}}\hspace{1.0cm}

	\caption{Examples of use of interaction nodes: 
	(a) association of gRNA and Cas9 into an active CRISPR complex and (b) the dissociation of that complex.}
	\label{exa:4d2}
	\end{figure}

\item A glyph at the point where an edge splits or joins represents a biochemical process, i.e., an \sbol{Interaction} with type and roles set by the process glyph. 
A biochemical process represented by a glyph at an edge junction SHOULD be represented using a glyph defined in \ref{apdx:sym:interactionnodes}. In this case, the interaction type MUST be contained within at least one of the glyph's associated terms.
In terms of the SBOL 2 data model, this means the glyph is equal to or a parent of at least one of the \sbol{types} for the \sbol{Interaction}, and that each associated \sbol{Participation} object has a \sbol{role} compatible with its position on the head or tail of the edge.
	Moreover, the glyph used SHOULD be the RECOMMENDED variant of the most specific applicable glyph.  Note that novel glyphs not defined in \ref{apdx:sym:interactionnodes} MAY be used, but SHOULD be proposed for adoption as described in \ref{sec:extension}.
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:4d2}.

	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\subfigure[MAY]{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/examples/4d-nonreactant.pdf}\label{exa:nonreactant}}\hspace{1.0cm}

	(b) Example of interaction node whose product plays a role in another interaction: dCas9 and gRNA associate to form a CRISPR complex, which then represses a promoter.}
	\label{exa:4d3}
	\end{figure}

\item An edge with its head at an interaction node MAY use an \sbol{Interaction} arrow head to indicate a \sbol{role} other than Reactant (SBO:0000010) in the biochemical process.
	Likewise, an edge with its tail at an interaction node MAY use an \sbol{Interaction} arrow head to indicate the \sbol{role} played by that product of the biochemical process in another \sbol{Interaction}.
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:4d3}.

	\subfigure[MUST NOT]{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/examples/4e-endtarget.pdf}}
	\caption{Examples of allowed and forbidden use of interactions with interactions: 
	(a) aTc inhibiting repression by TetR.
	(b) Multiple inhibitions of an interaction with two tails.
	(c) Interactions SHOULD NOT connect to only one head of a multi-head or tail of a multi-tail interaction.
	(d) interactions MUST NOT connect to the head or tail of another interaction.}
	\label{exa:4e}
	\end{figure}

\item An edge MAY have another edge at its head or tail, indicating that the interaction has a participant that is another interaction.
	This does not have a direct representation in the SBOL 2 data model. % but will have one in SBOL 3
	To avoid ambiguity, an edge SHOULD NOT connect to only one head of a multi-head arrow or one tail of a multi-tail arrow, and MUST connect only to the body of the edge, not its head or tail.
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:4e}.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Subsystems}

A distinguished subsystem within a system MAY be represented by a visual boundary in the form of closed polygon or closed curve.
Everything inside of the boundary is part of the subsystem, and everything outside of the boundary is not part of the subsystem; only certain diagram elements are allowed to cross a boundary, as defined below.
In terms of the SBOL 3 data model, the line represents a \sbol{SubComponent} included within the \sbol{Component} represented by the surrounding diagram, and boundary-crossing elements define \sbol{ComponentReference} relationships.
Note that the internals of a subsystem need not be shown: some details can be omitted or a subsystem can even be a ``black box'' with no internal structure at all being shown.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The boundary of subsystem SHOULD should be a rectangle or rounded rectangle. Boundary sides SHOULD be oriented vertically and horizontally.  
	It is RECOMMENDED that a subsystem be made visually distinct by making it larger than other glyphs and with a different line style.
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:moduleA}.

	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\subfigure[SHOULD]{\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/examples/moduleA-rectangle.pdf}}

	\caption{Examples of recommended and problematic subsystem boundaries: (a) two subsystems with visually distinct rectangular borders, (b) shows the same subsystems but with rounded rectangles and the second being a ``black box'' subsystem with no internal structure shown, (c) shows subsystems with non-rectilinear borders, and (d) shows a black-box subsystem that is not visually distinct from a sequence feature glyph.}
	\label{exa:moduleA}
	\end{figure}

\item Glyphs for sequence features and molecular species MUST NOT intersect with the boundary of a subsystem.
	An example is provided in~\ref{exa:moduleC}(a).

\item A nucleic acid backbone MAY cross the boundary of a subsystem. This represents an identification of the region of the nucleic acid construct contained within the subsystem and a compatible region of the larger construct represented in the enclosing system.
	In terms of the SBOL 3 data model, a nucleic acid backbone crossing a subsystem boundary represents the existence of  \sbol{Constraint} or \sbol{Location} objects in the enclosing \sbol{Component} that indicate that the nucleic acid sequence in the \sbol{SubComponent} is adjacent to the connected portions of nucleic acid sequence in the larger \sbol{Component}.
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:moduleC}(b).
	
\item An interaction edge MAY cross the boundary of a subsystem. This represents an interaction in the enclosing system that references the connected feature in the subsystem.
	In terms of the SBOL 3 data model, an interaction edge crossing a subsystem boundary represents an \sbol{Interaction} in the enclosing \sbol{Component} with a \sbol{Participation} that is a \sbol{ComponentReference} to the indicated \sbol{Feature} in the \sbol{SubComponent}.
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:moduleC}(c).

	(c) the promoter in the left subsystem and the regulated elements in the right subsystem are ordered to form a nucleic acid construct implementing a complete functional unit, 
	(d) Interaction in which the CDS inhibits the promoter in the subsystem (presumably via a repressor product), 
	(e) Interaction in which the CDS in the left subsystem inhibits the promoter in the right subsystem (presumably via a repressor product).}
	\label{exa:moduleC}
	\end{figure}


\item Small rectangles MAY be drawn on the outside of the subsystem boundary to represent its intended interface.
In terms of the SBOL 3 data model, these represent the \sbol{Interface} for the \sbol{SubComponent}, with each rectangle associated with a \sbol{Feature} designated as an \sbol{input}, \sbol{output}, or \sbol{nondirectional} element of the interface.
	An interface rectangle may be connected to an interaction edge head or tail to represent interactions with its associated feature. 
	If both an interface rectangle and a glyph for its associated feature are present in a diagram, then any interaction with the feature from outside of the subsystem MUST both pass through the interface rectangle and connect with the glyph.
	An interaction with a feature that does not pass through an interface rectangle then MAY be used to represent an unintended interaction with a non-interface element of the subsystem.
	Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:moduleD}.
% How do we show direction on a port?  We can't, really.

	\label{exa:moduleD}
	\end{figure}

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Labels}
The name of any object in a diagram is RECOMMENDED to be displayed as text within, adjacent to, or otherwise clearly visually connected to the object's associated glyph.  In terms of the SBOL 3 data model, this is the \sbol{name} property, and if no \sbol{name} is supplied then the \sbol{displayId} MAY be used instead.
Examples are provided in~\ref{exa:5}.

\subsection{Annotations}
Other text or graphics may be included as annotations with no constraint on their syntax or semantics.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Annotations SHOULD NOT be displayed in a way that allows them to be confused with other SBOL Visual elements.
\item Annotations SHOULD NOT be used to display information that can be displayed using other SBOL Visual elements.

\subsection{Criteria for Compliance with SBOL Visual}

A diagram of a biological system is compliant with SBOL Visual if it complies with all MUST and MUST NOT requirements as specified above.
A diagram is compliant with SBOL Visual best practices if it also complies with all RECOMMENDED, SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT statements as specified above.

Importantly, note that a non-SBOL glyph can be used in a compliant
diagram when its definition is a subset or superset of a definition that
does have an SBOL Visual glyph.  For example, a diagram that creates a
new glyph for a special type of promoter can be SBOL Visual compliant
even though there is an SBOL Visual glyph for a general promoter.

A piece of software or other system for producing diagrams is
compliant with SBOL Visual under the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The system MUST be capable of producing diagrams that are
  compliant with SBOL Visual.
\item If the system can also produce diagrams that are {\em not}
  compliant with SBOL Visual, it MUST clearly distinguish to the user
  between compliant and non-compliant usage and diagrams.
\end{enumerate}
