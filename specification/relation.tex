SBOL Visual 2.2 replaces SBOL Visual 2.1.
%
Substantive differences between SBOL Visual 2.2 and SBOL Visual 2.1 are marked with change bars identifying the version in which the new material was introduced.

SBOL Visual 2.2 also implicitly supersedes the previously replaced BBF RFC 115 (SBOL Visual 2.0), as well as BBF RFC 93 and BBF RFC 16 (prior versions of SBOL Visual).

Every glyph in SBOL Visual 2.2 corresponds to an element of the SBOL 2.3 data model.
SBOL Visual 2.2 also defines many terms by reference to SBOL 2.3, 
or by reference to the Sequence Ontology~\citep{SequenceOntology}
or the Systems Biology Ontology~\citep{SBO}.

SBOL Visual is intended to be compatible with the Systems Biology Graphical Notation Activity Flow Language (SBGN AF)~\citep{sbgn}, 
and species and interaction glyphs have been imported from that language (see: \ref{apdx:sym:species} and \ref{apdx:sym:interaction}).
Some aspects are also imported from the Systems Biology Graphical Notation Process Description Language (SBGN PD).
