## Associated SBO term(s)
SBO:0000247 Simple chemical

## Recommended Glyph and Alternates
The simple chemical glyph is any one of three small polygonal shapes, triangle, pentagon, or hexagon (in order: triangle, pentagon, hexagon):

Alternately, a simple chemical may also be represented a small circle:

## Prototypical Example

Arabinose

## Notes
It is RECOMMENDED that visual differentiation be maximized by associating each distinct species in a diagram with a different small geometric shape. Rotations may also be used (e.g., pentagon pointing up vs. pentagon pointing down).

It is RECOMMENDED that labels should be placed outside of the shapes rather than inside, to avoid squeezing the labels.

To avoid confusion with pills or ellipses, when the small circle alternative glyph is used, it SHOULD be significantly smaller than other types of molecular species glyphs, as indicated by the recommended scale of the glyph.
