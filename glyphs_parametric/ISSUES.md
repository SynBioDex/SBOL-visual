# Outstanding Issues

1. Many glyphs do not have a properly formed "d" attribute or it has not been updated. Need a script to cleanly create all of these.

2. Need to agree on path naming and ensuring we minimise paths to simplify customisation.

3. The origin (baseline start point) is (0,0) in all glyphs. This causes them to be cropped when viewed or imported into Powerpoint. Could we set up clipping planes to be automatically added such that only the glyph is visible or generate shifted versions?

4. We should agree on the formatting of the SVG files (this could make management easier longer term).
