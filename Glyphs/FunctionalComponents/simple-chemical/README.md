Alternately, a simple chemical may also be represented by one of several small simple geometric shapes, a circle, triangle, pentagon, or hexagon:

Finally, a simple chemical may also be represented directly by its chemical diagram, using any standard form thereof.

## Prototypical Example

Arabinose

## Notes
To avoid confusion with pills or ellipses, when the small circle alternative glyph is used, it SHOULD be significantly smaller than other types of molecular species glyphs, as indicated by the recommended scale of the glyph.
