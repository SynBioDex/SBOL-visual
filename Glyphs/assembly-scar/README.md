# Assembly Scar

## Associated SO term(s)
SO:0001953

## Recommended Glyph and Alternates
The assembly scar glyph is an "equal sign" image, the pattern produced by the union of a 5' sticky end and 3' sticky end glyph. The scar will cover the backbone, creating a visual break suggesting the potential disruption associated with a scar:
