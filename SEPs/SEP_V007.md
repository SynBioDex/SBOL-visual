## Abstract

This SEP proposes a systematic set of "stem-top" glyphs representing small sites affecting DNA, RNA, or protein. The glyphs in this system are Biopolymer Location, Stability Element, and Cleavage Site.

## 1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>

Stability Element and Cleavage site currently form a semi-systematic language for talking about two common types of small site using "stem-top" glyphs. There are several reasons to try to improve on the current system, however:

- The "circle pin" for stability site conflicts with common usage of "circle pin" to designate generic locations (in biology and elsewhere)
- There has been confusion about whether the protein symbols have a dashed stem or two lines for a stem.
- It is easy to confuse RNA and protein glyphs, since "dashed line" has no physical intuition
- When possible, line style is supposed to be reserved and not specified in glyphs
- Nuclease sites don't use the same system as protease and ribonuclease

## 2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>

This SEP proposes a systematic set of "stem-top" glyphs representing small sites affecting DNA, RNA, or protein.  The glyphs in this system are the current Stability Element and Cleavage Site glyphs, plus a new "Biopolymer Location" glyph

### Biopolymer Location

Associated SO term(s):

SO:0000699 (Junction, Boundary, Breakpoint)

SO:0001236 (Base)

SO:0001237 (Amino Acid)

This can thus represent either an SBOL "Cut" location or a "Range" or length 1

### Cleavage Site

Associated SO term(s)

SO:0001956 (Protease Site)

SO:0001977 (Ribonuclease Site)

SO:0001687 (Restriction Enzyme Recognition Site), SO:0001688 (Restriction Enzyme Cleavage Junction)

Note: Restriction site previously also associated with SO:0000061, but that was incorrect, since it refers to the binding site and *not* the location of cleavage)

Note: SO does not currently have Junction equivalents for ribonuclease and protease; a request to add these will be made if this SEP is approved.

### Stability Element

Associated SO term(s)

SO:0001955 (Protein Stability Element)

SO:0001957, SO:0001546 (RNA Stability Element)


### Recommended Glyph and Alternates

In this system:

- the stem glyph indicates whether the site affects DNA, RNA, or protein
- the top glyph indicates the type of site

### Stems
There are several proposals for the DNA / RNA / protein system for stems (showing in order left to right):

- Straight, Wavy, Looping lines:

Stability tops:

- Shield

### Notes
 Biopolymer Location is a general glyph for all zero- and one-length sequence features, including insertion and deletion sites and X-ase cut sites.

Biopolymer Location does not cover stability sites, since their length is typically multiple bases / amino acids.

## 3. Examples <a name='example'></a>

CRISPR-targeted insertion site, protease site

## 4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>

Some of the choices may conflict with current usage, and alternatives may not be a viable solution, depending on which options are chosen. 

## 5. Discussion <a name='discussion'></a>

Alternatives currently without support:

### Stems:
- Current system: [nothing], dashed, straight:
