# No Glyph Assigned

## Associated SBO term(s)
Any SBO type that is not covered by any glyph besides the root

## Recommended Glyph and Alternates
When a species has no assigned glyph it is RECOMMENDED that a user provide their own glyph. The user is also encouraged to submit the new glyph for possible adoption into the SBOLv standard.

An alternative option is to have a bracket, suggesting information that needs to be filled in:

![glyph specification](no-glyph-assigned-specification.png)

## Prototypical Example

No Glyph Assigned is intended to be used for any chemical species whose type is not covered by other SBOL Visual glyphs.

## Notes
No Glyph Assigned is intended for molecular species with a defined specific type that happens to not yet be covered by available approved glyphs (other than the root). It is more likely to appear in machine-generated diagrams than in human-generated diagrams, since humans are likely to invent and use their own glyph for the purpose.
