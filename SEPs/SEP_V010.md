## Abstract

This SEP proposes to add arrow types to represent interactions.


## 1. Rationale <a name="rationale"></a>

We need to represent interactions of different types.  As much as possible, we would like to adhere to standards already proposed in the SBGN-AF language.  Should though be easy to draw, scale properly, and be consistent with what synthetic biologists are already using in their diagrams.  

## 2. Specification <a name="specification"></a>

### Stimulation

#### Associated SBO term(s)

SBO:0000170 Stimulation

#### Recommended Glyph and Alternates

An arrow with an head that is empty or of a different color than the line, per SBGN:

#### Prototypical Example

Activation of pTAL14 promoter by Gal4VP16 activator

### Inhibition

#### Associated SBO term(s)

SBO:0000169 Inhibition

#### Recommended Glyph and Alternates

An arrow whose sink is a bar, suggesting blocking, per SBGN:

#### Prototypical Example

Repression of pTAL14 promoter by TAL14


### Control

#### Associated SBO term(s)

SBO:0000168 Control

#### Recommended Glyph and Alternates

An arrow with a diamond head, per SBGN:

#### Prototypical Example

Inversion of a sequence flanked by FRT sites by FLP recombinase


### Process

#### Associated SBO term(s)
SBO:0000375 Process

#### Recommended Glyph and Alternates

An arrow with a filled head the same color of the line, per SBGN:

#### Prototypical Example

Production of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) from the gfp Coding Sequence

#### Notes:
The assocated SBO term also covers
- SBO:0000176 Biochemical Reaction
- SBO:0000589 Genetic Production (source is DNA component, sink is usually RNA or Macromolecule)
- SBO:0000177 Non-covalent Binding (sink is a Complex)

### Degradation

#### Associated SBO term(s)

SBO:0000179 Degradation

#### Recommended Glyph and Alternates

Identical to the Process glyph, but with an empty set at the sink of the arrowhead:

#### Prototypical Example

Cellular recycling of mRNA


## 3. Examples <a name='example'></a>

See examples in individual glyph proposals


## 4. Backwards Compatibility <a name='compatibility'></a>

SBOL Visual does not currently support interactions, so there are no backwards compatibility issues.
