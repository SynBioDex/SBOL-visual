# Complex

## Associated SBO term(s)
SBO:0000253 Non-covalent complex

## Recommended Glyph and Alternates
The RECOMMENDED glyph for a complex is a composite of the glyphs for the molecules of comprising the complex.  For example, a protein bound to a simple chemical, a protein bound to a guide RNA, or two proteins bound together:

This may also be applied to show complex formation (binding) of a molecule to a nucleic acid backbone by compositing the glyph for the molecule with appropriate portion of the diagram the nucleic acid backbone.  For example, a protein binding to the promoter of a functional unit:

An alternative is the SBGN "cornered rectangle" glyph for a complex:

## Prototypical Example

Arabinose bound to AraC
