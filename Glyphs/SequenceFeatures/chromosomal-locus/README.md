# Chromosomal Locus

## Associated SO term(s)

SO:0000830 Chromosome Part

## Recommended Glyph and Alternates

The glyph to indicate integration into a chromosome is an S-shaped curve of the backbone, suggesting something that might be part of a larger looping structure:

## Prototypical Example

_B. subtilis_ amyE locus


## Notes

Complementary "left" and "right" versions of this glyph SHOULD be used together, flanking the region whose genomic context is being described.

The Omitted Detail glyph SHOULD generally be contatenated to indicate that there is information about the chromosome not being represented.

Examples of RECOMMENDED usage:

- A functional unit consisting of promoter, ribosome entry site, CDS, and terminator, all integrated together into the chromosome:

- Two functional units, one integrated into the amyE locus, another integrated into the ganA locus:
