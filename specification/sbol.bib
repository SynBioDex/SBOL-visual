  abstract    = "Circuit diagrams and Unified Modeling Language diagrams are
                 just two examples of standard visual languages that help
                 accelerate work by promoting regularity, removing ambiguity
                 and enabling software tool support for communication of
                 complex information. Ironically, despite having one of the
                 highest ratios of graphical to textual information, biology
                 still lacks standard graphical notations. The recent deluge of
                 biological knowledge makes addressing this deficit a pressing
                 concern. Toward this goal, we present the Systems Biology
                 Graphical Notation (SBGN), a visual language developed by a
                 community of biochemists, modelers and computer scientists.
                 SBGN consists of three complementary languages: process
                 diagram, entity relationship diagram and activity flow
                 diagram. Together they enable scientists to represent networks
                 of biochemical interactions in a standard, unambiguous way. We
                 believe that SBGN will foster efficient and accurate
                 representation, visualization, storage, exchange and reuse of
                 information on all kinds of biological knowledge, from gene
                 regulation, to metabolism, to cellular signaling.",
